  Had to plug and pump up a 38mm gravel tire on today's ride, and my pump (Silca Tattico) is designed more for road tires; took about 160 strokes to get the tire from squishy to 'just right,' and that was a lot of fun in the high heat and humidity. This got me thinking that I might buy a Lezyne pump designed for higher volume tires from their HV series...The question is, which one? They have quite a few, and it's pretty hard to discern any differences. Produce page here.

  content: "Hi, Clemence.

  From what I've researched regarding the Trek FX range, is that once you're into the FX 7.7 to 7.9 range, they are basically a carbon Trek Madone or Trek Domane road/race bike with flat bars. Thus, the maximum tire clearance is not a whole lot--28mm max is a good expectation, and you'd have to mount 32s (and measure them) on your own wheels and see if you could mount them on the bike you're looking at.
  
  Lesser Trek FX's throughout the years have normal generous clearances, my 2014 FX 7.3 will clear 42mm tires front and rear. FX 7.4s to 7.6s came with carbon forks instead of aluminum (7.3) or steel (7.2 and less), which is something I've been looking for. My 7.3 is great though, and will handle gravel easily with it's large tires. That is, if I ever bother with gravel. The paint is so pretty and so pristine that my road-biased self just enjoys it on the road (albeit with road bike componentry)!",

  content: "Generally, repeated issues with broken spokes indicates either damage to the rim, meaning that the metal hoop of the rim is physically bent while under no tension, or that the spokes are at the end of their fatigue life.

  Any wheel has an expected use life, and usually, you will wear a track in the aluminum rim from braking forces before the fatigue life of the stainless steel spoke becomes an issue. However, if the rim is damaged, as referenced in your previous question, then the tension of the wheel cannot be evenly consistent, because some spokes must be tighter than others in order to hold the rim true and straight. If our wheel is unevenly tensioned, it allows a far greater amount of movement of each spoke during the revolution of a wheel, and this stresses the spokes beyond their designed strength. And you break more spokes.",

  - The wheel is poorly built -- over tensioned, improperly crossed, wrong side of the flange, etc.

  - You're too hard on the wheels (for the ruggedness of the particular wheels).
  - The spokes are corroded or otherwise reaching end of life.
  Riding without truing the wheel doesn't help the situation, but wouldn't by itself cause a problem unless the tension was so far off that a few spokes were bearing the lion's share of the load.",
