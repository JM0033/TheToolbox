  From what I've researched regarding the Trek FX range, is that once you're into the FX 7.7 to 7.9 range, they are basically a carbon Trek Madone or Trek Domane road/race bike with flat bars. Thus, the maximum tire clearance is not a whole lot--28mm max is a good expectation, and you'd have to mount 32s (and measure them) on your own wheels and see if you could mount them on the bike you're looking at.

  Lesser Trek FX's throughout the years have normal generous clearances, my 2014 FX 7.3 will clear 42mm tires front and rear. FX 7.4s to 7.6s came with carbon forks instead of aluminum (7.3) or steel (7.2 and less), which is something I've been looking for. My 7.3 is great though, and will handle gravel easily with it's large tires. That is, if I ever bother with gravel. The paint is so pretty and so pristine that my road-biased self just enjoys it on the road (albeit with road bike componentry)!",

  content: "Generally, repeated issues with broken spokes indicates either damage to the rim, meaning that the metal hoop of the rim is physically bent while under no tension, or that the spokes are at the end of their fatigue life.

  Any wheel has an expected use life, and usually, you will wear a track in the aluminum rim from braking forces before the fatigue life of the stainless steel spoke becomes an issue. However, if the rim is damaged, as referenced in your previous question, then the tension of the wheel cannot be evenly consistent, because some spokes must be tighter than others in order to hold the rim true and straight. If our wheel is unevenly tensioned, it allows a far greater amount of movement of each spoke during the revolution of a wheel, and this stresses the spokes beyond their designed strength. And you break more spokes.",

If you have options on several other shops to check out, you might get some recommendations from local riders as well, if you have that resource. There may be some online reviews as well, but be wary of them, as one always should with online reviews.

  If only a particular portion of the brake system is worn out (say the caliper), then you would only need to replace the caliper, not the entire system. There could be a point where enough of the system is failing/worn that a full replacement would be more economical compared to piecemealing in some new parts while keeping a few older ones.",

  content: "I need a replacement spoke for a Shimano WH-MT500 29er QR. Shimano dealer manual does not mention the spoke length. I've figued out its a 13G, double butted spoke but unsure about the length. I've measured other spokes on the bike and from the hub to the base of the rim, including nipple, they are 290 mm. There are various sizes to buy online including 290 mm and 300 mm. is there additional length beneath the rim I need to account for? 290 mm or 300 mm?",

  content: "The easiest method would be to remove one of the spokes, measure the length , and reinsert the spoke. The length of the spoke needs to be such that all of the spoke's thread is inserted into the nipple's thread. Iirc most nipples have 19 revolutions of thread. Which should be approx 8-10mm length. Keep in mind the first part of the nipple is unthreaded (bore).",

This should be approx 3-4 mm for most wheels. But as previously mentioned the other method is more accurate (measuring removed spoke).",

  content: "Bicycles (and other two-wheeled vehicles like motorcycles) constantly need righting while riding. That is done mostly by the rider. If the bicycle starts to tip to the side, you automatically steer to the same side so you induce an opposite effect. This is helped by the head angle, the wheel trail and the gyroscopic effect, but active steering plays the biggest role. If a bicycle leans to one side for a longer time, it starts to turn or it falls over. (In fact, this is how you steer a bike in a corner: you steer in the opposite direction to make it lean into the corner and then you just keep it leaning until you've taken the turn.)",

    If the goal is to learn riding, do some training and then remove the training wheels (even if my daughter still remembers how angry she was when I did). They do not give a lot of useful skills so can be ditched early or not used at all.",
